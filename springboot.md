# Spring Boot and Microservices Course Outline

## 1. Introduction to SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
    - A class should have only one reason to change.
    - Example: A class handling business logic and persistence should be split into separate classes.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    - Example: Use interfaces or abstract classes to extend functionality without changing existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
    - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
    - Example: Derived classes should extend the base class without altering its expected behavior.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
    - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
    - Example: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
    - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - Example: Use dependency injection to reduce coupling between components.

## 2. Introduction to Microservices

- **Definition and Characteristics**
    - Microservices are an architectural style where an application is composed of loosely coupled services.
- **Benefits and Challenges**
    - Benefits: Scalability, flexibility, fault isolation.
    - Challenges: Complexity, data consistency, inter-service communication.
- **Use Cases**
    - Examples: E-commerce platforms, real-time data processing.

## 3. Introduction to Spring Boot

- **What is Spring Boot?**
    - A framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Boot vs. Spring Framework**
    - Spring Boot simplifies configuration and setup compared to traditional Spring Framework.

  <summary>Comparison of Spring Boot and Spring Framework</summary>

  | Feature/Aspect         | Spring Framework                      | Spring Boot                          |
    |------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | **Configuration**      | Requires extensive XML or Java-based configuration. | Simplifies configuration with auto-configuration and annotations. |
  | **Setup Time**         | More time-consuming setup due to manual configurations. | Quick setup with Spring Initializr and embedded server options. |
  | **Project Structure**  | Flexible structure; can be complex based on project requirements. | Opinionated project structure with a standard convention. |
  | **Dependency Management** | Manual management of dependencies; may require additional configuration. | Dependency management handled automatically with a starter dependency system. |
  | **Embedded Server**    | Requires separate configuration to run on an embedded server. | Comes with embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.) out of the box. |
  | **Microservices Support** | Supports microservices but requires more configuration. | Designed for microservices with features like Spring Cloud integration. |
  | **Development Speed**  | Slower development due to extensive boilerplate code. | Faster development with less boilerplate and rapid prototyping. |
  | **Testing Support**    | Requires configuration for testing components. | Provides built-in support for testing with annotations like `@SpringBootTest`. |
  | **Community & Ecosystem** | Large community, but Spring Boot has become the preferred choice. | Rapidly growing community; increasingly preferred for new applications. |
  | **Learning Curve**     | Steeper learning curve due to complexity. | Easier to learn due to simplified features and clear documentation. |
